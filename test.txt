Building a text editor in C shows how powerful the language is for file handling,
memory management, and input/output control.






C’s standard library offers functions like fopen, fwrite, and fclose to handle files.

C’s efficiency and speed make it great for tasks like building a text editor.

Many popular editors, like Vim and Emacs, were originally developed in C. 
They highlight how the language remains relevant for system-level programming.

When building a text editor in C, you work with data structures like arrays and linked lists to store text. 
You also implement features like search, replace, undo, and redo. 
Terminal control codes help manage the cursor and screen, making the editor responsive.

C’s simplicity and efficiency allow for a clean, powerful text editor. 
This project helps developers better understand file handling and user interaction with low-level programming.
Text editors are essential for developers, from simple ones to advanced IDEs. 
They help write and edit code easily.
